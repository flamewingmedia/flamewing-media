            <div id="articleContent">
                <p>Imagine, if you will, that you’ve just placed an order for a brand new coffee table online. You would expect all the parts — The tabletop, the legs, the screws and bolts, and instructions on how to put the whole thing together — To arrive in one box in a single delivery. However, you unknowingly bought your table not directly from a manufacturer, but instead from some middle man who orders all the individual pieces separately from different companies and has them delivered directly to you one by one.</p>
                <p>So now, you’re getting a swathe of packages at your door. One day, an envelope with just the screws arrive. The next day you get one of the table’s legs. The day after that, the tabletop arrives, and so on. This would be really annoying, wouldn’t it? Nothing about this process is simple or easy. You have to sit around and wait for days as each part is brought to you before you can even begin to assemble the darned thing.</p>
                <p>This is exactly how solutions like Wix, WordPress, or Squarespace work. In this analogy, the coffee table is your website, you are the web browser, and the page builder is the middle man you ordered the table from. When you build a site using services like these, every piece of content you add — The words, the images, the layout — is stored in a database somewhere deep on an array of servers to later be searched for, dug out, and pieced together like Frankenstein’s monster before it can be loaded onto the browser.</p>
                <p>Even though this process generally can be done within seconds, it doesn’t happen just once — It occurs every single time someone accesses your site. A few seconds might sound like no big deal, but it actually matters a lot. Research shows that 40-57% of all internet users will abandon a website if it hasn’t fully loaded on the page within three seconds. That’s half of your potential customers gone, not because your services or products aren’t quality, but simply because your website is too slow.</p>
                <p>At Flamewing, we choose to do things a little differently. We are the legit coffee table manufacturer you would expect from the earlier analogy. Nothing we do is stored in a database or a library that has to be accessed later. We don’t utilize any frameworks or pre-fabricated templates. Instead, we meticulously hand-write each and every line of code, with all the content and instructions on how to lay it out on the page, to be delivered to a visitor’s web browser in a single package.</p>
                <p>Our approach gives us the flexibility necessary to ensure that your site is not only responsive and beautiful, but also lightning-fast and secure. We only code what is appropriate for your needs without the added bloat that often comes with site generators and page builders. The experiences we build often load in under a second, so far fewer visitors will abandon your page and turn to your competitors, which means more sales and more revenue to your business.</p>
                <p>If you are concerned about potential problems with your existing website, we recommend you run it through this analyzer: <a class="c" href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank">https://pagespeed.web.dev/</a> . This is a developer tool created by Google that breaks down where the problems in your site may lie. Websites built with other solutions often have very low speed, accessibility, and SEO scores. The Flamewing guarantee is that our sites will have near-perfect performance (and we often score a perfect 100 on each metric)!</p>
