            <button class="accordion">Why wouldn’t I just use WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, or something similar?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Page builders like Wix or WordPress often bog down your site with bloated code, causing slow load times, accessibility issues, and performance problems. While these web solutions work for some and have their place in the market, all of our sites are hand-coded to ensure the absolute best performance.</p>
                <p>In addition, every moment you spend using services like these - Fixing something that isn’t working or making sure that everything looks nice - is a moment you could have spent working on or building other aspects of your business. With us, you won’t have to worry about this frustrating process. We handle it all for you. <a class="c" href="blog1.html">If you'd like to know exactly what advantages our sites have over ones built with services like these, click here!</a></p>

            <button class="accordion">What kind of clients are your websites best suited for?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Our websites are most suitable for businesses who provide a service to their clients and operate in a local market. Some examples of the kinds of businesses best suited for our services include:</p>
                <ul>

            <button class="accordion">Do you do eCommerce (websites with a shopping cart and order placing)?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Unfortunately, we are not equipped to handle eCommerce sites. If your primary business focus is selling and shipping product, we recommend you work with a larger marketing agency to have your vision brought to life!</p>

            <button class="accordion">How long does the process take?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>From the moment you sign on to the day of launch could take anywhere from four to six weeks. If you're working with a deadline, reach out! We'd be happy to discuss options with you. <a class="c" href="/services.html#process">You can learn more about our process here.</a></p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>Absolutely! Not only are the sites we build mobile friendly, we design each and every one with a mobile-first philosophy in mind. Smart phones eat up a majority of the “market share” when it comes to internet traffic, so we ensure that your website will look, feel, and perform its best on them. <a class="c" href="blog2.html">If you're interested in how exactly we achieve this - click here!</a></p>
